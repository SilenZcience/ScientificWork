  abstract  = {Esoteric programming languages are challenging to learn, but their unusual features and constraints may serve to improve programming ability. From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive  appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this   popularity.   We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation.  Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages.   Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible for anyone to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe  our most important contribution is to draw more attention to   the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.},
