While providing a comprehensive overview of the main components we emphasize selected new insights we arrived at while developing and testing the solver.},

PROB's animation facilities allow users to gain confidence in their specifications, and unlike the animator provided by the B-Toolkit, the user does not have to guess the right values for the operation arguments or choice variables. PROB contains a model checker and a constraint-based checker, both of which can be used to detect various errors in B specifications. We present our first experiences in using PROB on several case studies, highlighting that PROB enables users to uncover errors that are not easily discovered by existing tools.},
